GoogleApi Mirror for Chrome
=============

This Google Chrome plugin automatically redirects all traffic to
ajax.googleapis.com to our CDN. 

ajax.googleapis.com is used extensively in websites outside China to serve
common javascript libraries such as angular.js and jquery.

Modern website and browser render the page after these libraries are loaded,
but it will never happen inside GFW :-(
